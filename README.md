## Excercises

### 1. Change binding feedback event

From:

```cs
<input type="text" value="{{model.Name$::change}}" placeholder="Name">
```

To:

```cs
<input type="text" value="{{model.Name$::input}}" placeholder="Name">
```

## Testing

### Prepare your environment

Before running the steps, you need to:

- Download and install Visual Studio 2015 to run the tests
- Download and install Java, required by Selenium Standalone Server
- Download Selenium Standalone Server and the drivers (Edge and Chrome) using the instructions at http://starcounter.io/guides/web/acceptance-testing-with-selenium/#install-selenium-standalone-server-and-browser-drivers

### Run the test (from Visual Studio)

1. Start Selenium Remote Driver: `java -jar selenium-server-standalone-2.52.0.jar`
2. Open `KitchenSink.sln` in Visual Studio and enable Test Explorer (Test > Window > Test Explorer)
3. Start the KitchenSink app
4. Press "Run all" in Test Explorer
   - If you get an error about some packages not installed, right click on the project in Solution Explorer. Choose "Manage NuGet Packages" and click on "Restore".
5. Don't touch your keyboard or mouse while the tests are being executed :)

### Run the test (from command line)

1. Start Selenium Remote Driver: `java -jar selenium-server-standalone-2.52.0.jar`
2. Go to the solution folder and run `nuget restore` to make sure you have the test dependencies (listed in `test\KitchenSink.Tests\packages.config`)
 - if you don't have `nuget.exe`, get it from [here](http://docs.nuget.org/Consume/Command-Line-Reference)
3. Build the solution ('msbuild KitchenSink.sln')
4. Start the KitchenSink app (`run.bat`)
5. Start the KitchenSink.Test runner (`test.bat`)
6. Don't touch your keyboard or mouse while the tests are being executed :)
